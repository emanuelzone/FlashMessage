# FlashMessageControl

Hello there, 

This is a result of a lesson in a school project.

Flash messages are used to inform the user about the state of the action he / she has made or simply displaying information to users. These types of messages can be generated using this component. Below you will find some examples of instant messaging with Font Awesome.

You can easily remove or add your own messages, but you must specify them in the flashmessages.css. This version is also used with Font Awesome which you can download via https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/..
